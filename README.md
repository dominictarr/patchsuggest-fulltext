# patchsuggest-fulltext

Autosuggest via fulltext search.

the cool thing this allows is easy linking to other messages.
type `?{query}` and you get an suggest box of messages that (seem like they) match.
Select one and it inserts a markdown link to that message (and with the search term as link text)
